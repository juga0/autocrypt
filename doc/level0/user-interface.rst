Common User Interface for Autocrypt-compatible clients
======================================================

One of the goals of Autocrypt is that the user's experience won't vary
much from their normal e-mail experience.  However, there are a few
user interactions that might come up for Autocrypt-enabled clients,
and we want to ensure that there is a common understanding of what the
user might see should they end up needing to configure the client.

Autocrypt-enabled Mail User Aagents SHOULD follow this guidance
closely for a smoother experience for users across all
Autocrypt-enabled applications.

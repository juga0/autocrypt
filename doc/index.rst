Autocrypt - E-mail Encryption for Everyone
==========================================

**STATUS of all docs here**: early stages, under discussion before and
 at the `AME2016 meetup in Berlin Dec 14-18th
 <https://github.com/mailencrypt/ame2016>`_

Email has been declared dead many times but refuses to die. It remains
the largest open federated identity and messaging system, anchors the
web and mobile phones and continues to relay sensitive information
between citizens and organisations.  However, bringing pervasive
end-to-end encryption to this infrastructure has failed so far. The
Autocrypt effort aims to develop opportunistic mail encryption drafts and
working code. To ease adoption, it restricts itself to only require
changes from mail programs (MUAs) but no changes whatsoever from mail
providers. It follows recommendations from RFC7435 "Opportunistic
security" and specifically avoids talking to users about keys without
them having asked for it first. **The overall goal of Autocrypt is to
help massively increase the overall number of encrypted mails world
wide**.

Current work-in-progress specs:

:doc:`Autocrypt key discovery <mua-keydiscovery>` presents and
     discusses how mail programs negotiate encryption with each other.

:doc:`Autocrypt key format <key-formats>` discusses the precise header
     and key format.

:doc:`Autocrypt levels <levels>` discusses level0 and level1 support.

:doc:`Autocrypt MUA internals <mua-internals>` discusses requirements,
     operations and the state MUAs need to keep in order to implement
     the Autocrypt protocols.

:doc:`Autocrypt multi-device management <multi-device>` discusses how
     to make several MUAs share secret key material, also involving
     questions of key backup. Autocrypt-supporting MUAs communicate
     via mail with each other in order to synchronize secrets.

    :doc:`Autocrypt reasons <reasons>` lists reasons and frequent questions.

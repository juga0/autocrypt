Autocrypt - E-mail Encryption for Everyone
==========================================

**The Autocrypt project aims to ease end-to-end email encryption 
such that it eventually happens automatically.**

E-mail has been declared dead many times but refuses to die. It remains
the largest open federated identity and messaging system, anchors the
web, mobiles and continues to relay sensitive information between
citizens and organisations. And that despite the constant drag of
apps who want to lure us into in-app-only communication.

The autocrypt project is driven by various mail app developers, hackers 
and researchers who are willing to take fresh approaches, learn from
past mistakes, and collectively aim to increase the overall encryption
of E-Mail in the net.  The group effort was born and named "autocrypt"
on December 17th 2016 by ~20 people during a 5-day meeting at the 
OnionSpace in Berlin. It's a dynamic, fun process which is open to 
new people, influences and contributions. No need to tweet but
we have :ref:`contact channels` and :ref:`upcoming events`
where you may talk with us.

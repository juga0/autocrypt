- PR62: rework autocrypt peer state update description
  came from: move "pah" attributes (parsed autocrypt header) to "peerstate"
  and "update internal state" section at least somewhat
  (remove TODOs, ...)
  dkg, oliver, ...

Setup Message:

- User ID does not need to match an email (it's "decorative") (PR, holger)

- alphanumeric versus number "setup codes" (discussion)
  and also consider error-correction

- refining/fixating the symmetric "setup code" encryption and Setup Message format
  (defending particularly against secret-key-injection because if we let the user
  go through the effort of transfering 128 bit of entropy out-of-band we should try
  hard to protect a MITM exchanging keys)  (discussion based on a PR?)
  three known solutions:
  - mandate exact PGP message
  - put and verify Setup Code in the decrypted cleartext of the Setup Message
  - just say "the message MUST be decrypted using the Setup Code" and
    rely on people calling their engines/APIs correctly and note that particularly
    gpg might appear to have decrypted symmetricatally but did something else

- do a PR motivating the prefer-encrypt=mutual before diving into the
  details of it (dkg)

- gossiping keys

- Phase in new keys  (ed25559)

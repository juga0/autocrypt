- PR62: rework autocrypt peer state update description
  came from: move "pah" attributes (parsed autocrypt header) to "peerstate"
  and "update internal state" section at least somewhat
  (remove TODOs, ...)

- PR63: Put secret key into a mime structure, add prefer-encrypt into its
  header
  came from: include own prefer-encrypt setting in the autocrypt setup message
  so that the other client can start off from the "imported" prefer-encrypt
  setting (so e.g. a "mutual" setting carries over and will not lead to
  flip-flopping when sending mails to third parties which means that the
  other client will flip-flop the "encrypt" checkbox (if it has one))
  (Bjoern, PR)

  - morning discussion: maybe just mandate that the Setup Message
    has a proper Autocrypt header which contains the ``prefer-encrypt``
    settings instead of encoding it somehow into the message

  - separate identifier for Setup Messages so that they are easy
    to recognize

open Issues
 - #67 clarify secret key encoding

Setup Message:

- User ID does not need to match an email (it's "decorative") (PR, holger)

- alphanumeric versus number "setup codes" (discussion)
  and also consider error-correction

- refining/fixating the symmetric "setup code" encryption and Setup Message format
  (defending particularly against secret-key-injection because if we let the user
  go through the effort of transfering 128 bit of entropy out-of-band we should try
  hard to protect a MITM exchanging keys)  (discussion based on a PR?)
  three known solutions:
  - mandate exact PGP message
  - put and verify Setup Code in the decrypted cleartext of the Setup Message
  - just say "the message MUST be decrypted using the Setup Code" and
    rely on people calling their engines/APIs correctly and note that particularly
    gpg might appear to have decrypted symmetricatally but did something else

- do a PR motivating the prefer-encrypt=mutual before diving into the
  details of it (dkg)

- gossiping keys

- Phase in new keys  (ed25559)

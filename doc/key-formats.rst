Key Formats for Autocrypt
=========================

``p`` - OpenPGP Based
-----------------

Autocrypt requires keys of a certain format to reduce the requirements
for implementations.

If OpenPGP key format is used, the message also uses OpenPGP Message
encoding (PGP/MIME, RFC 3156)

**For New Users**

We only include a minimum key in the headers that has:

* a primary key ``Kp``

  * a uid that is the email address
  * a self signature

* one encryption subkey ``Ke``

  * a signature for the subkey by the primary key

â€¦ and nothing else. For maximum interoperability and sanity a
certificate sent by an Autocrypt-enabled agent MUST contain exactly
these five OpenPGP packets.

For the key algorithms used at a given level of support see levels.rst

**Reasoning**

*Why ed25519+cv25519*

short keys for short header lines

*why email address as uid*

 Possibilities for uid we considered:

 ======= == == == === ==
 Option  SC BC VO RvK SR
 ======= == == == === ==
 no uid            x  x
 email   x  x   x  x
 fixed         x   x  x
 hash    x      x   x x
 ======= == == == === ==

SC: self-claim. This was very important to us for usability
reasons. This restricted us to either use the email directly or
hashed.

BC: backwards compatibility

VO: valid OpenPGP

RvK: allows revocations using keyservers

SR: Spam resistant/publicly list email addresses

Using a salted hash of the email address for the uid to not list them
on keyservers would prevent the privacy issue of public mail addresses
but the key should not be uploaded in the first place.

Accidental or malicious uploading of keys with associated email
addresses should be prevented by introducing a flag at the keys that
says that keyservers shouldn't accept it.  See `issue #7
<https://github.com/mailencrypt/inbome/issues/7>`_.


**For current OpenPGP users**

* What about other keys, that i have been using with other properties?
  (smart-card, RSA, ...)

  * You can still create a compatible header with a tool we will
    provide. We are targeting users who have not used pgp
    before. Nevertheless most clients will still support other key
    formats. But they are not required to.

Autocrypt Secret Key Backup
===========================

This is for Autocrypt Level 1 or later...

The MUA generates a strong "backup code" and gets the user to write it
down somewhere.  Then it serializes its secret key material into a
message encrypted by the the backup code.  This message is given a
custom header and is sent to the account in question::

    Autocrypt-Secret-Key-Backup: key_backup_data=<encrypted_secret_key>
    From: alice@example.net
    To: alice@example.net

.. todo::

   should the MUA store the message in the SMA, or store it to file or
   what?

Prompting the user for backup code?

Note also that the backup code MUST be strong -- it is subject to
brute force attacks by anyone who holds a copy.

   say something about the relationship between backup and sync

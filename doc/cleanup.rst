Cleanup needed
--------------

RFC 2231 talks about the elements of a MIME header as "parameters"
instead of "attributes".  RFC 2045 specifies the same vocab.  We
should normalize.

Let's use "cert" where we mean "cert" and "key" where we mean "key"

"INBOME" should be replaced with to "Autocrypt"

need a tight document for what is expected of level 0 clients.

user-facing material probably should use "app" -- for technical
documentation, we need to settle internally on "agent" or "client" or
"MUAA"

glossary for technical documentation.

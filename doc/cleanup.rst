Cleanup needed
--------------

RFC 2231 talks about the elements of a MIME header as "parameters"
instead of "attributes".  RFC 2045 specifies the same vocab.  We
should normalize.

Let's use "cert" where we mean "cert" and "key" where we mean "key"

need a tight document for what is expected of level 0 clients.

user-facing material probably should use "app" -- for technical
documentation, we need to settle internally on "agent" or "client" or
"MUAA"

glossary for technical documentation.

we should use "email" or "e-mail" consistently in these docs

Avoid Autocrypt-Encryption: -- should be just Autocrypt:

rst markup might need cleanup.

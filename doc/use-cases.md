Use cases that Autocrypt should handle smoothly
===============================================

**fatal loss of secrets use case**: Someone is sending me encrypted
  mail and my MUA permanently doesn't have access to the decryption
  secret and also not a revocation cert.

**temporary second device**: i don't have access to my usual MUAs,
  only have webmail without access/support for mail encryption.  I'd
  like to receive and send (cleartext) mails without problems and
  then, after turning to use my original device/MUA again, send
  encrypted mails without problems.

**Autocrypt only on secondary device**: I use webmail most of the
  time. But for a small subset of my communication i want to be able
  to use encryption (My friend said we need this). It should not mess
  with my other mails though.

**change to non-encrypting device**: i don't use an
  Autocrypt-enabled MUA anymore and want to receive/send mails
  without problems with peers where messages were previously
  encrypted, however.

**setup first device/MUA**:  

**setup another device/MUA**:

**loss of one out of N devices**:

**compose mail**: i want to send a mail.

**compose encrypted mail**: i want to send an encrypted mail to
  someone.

**compose unencrypted mail**: i want to force my mail program to send
  unencrypted mail.

**search in body of mails**: i want to search in mail bodies
  (independent of their encryptedness).

**validate keys**: i meet one of my peers and i want to be sure there
  is no / has not been an attack against our encryption.

**add a contact**: i meet someone who also uses encryption and want to
  start encrypted communication with them.

**deal with compromise**: i suspect my encryption is compromised.

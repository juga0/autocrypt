Shared MUAA Messaging Archive
------------------------------------

characteristics/requirements of of what SMAs need to provide:

- a SMA can be implemented on top of IMAP commands 

- is used to synchronize states between MUAAs. We use "MUAAs" to
  indicate a particular MUA/Account combination because synchronization
  happens betweens accounts managed by different MUAs.

- is used to send and receive messages between MUAAs (concurrently),
  for example pairing requests, initial Autocrypt setup (of first MUAA),
  updates to received remote Autocrypt encryption keys.

- A MUAA needs to be able to detect if there is any other MUAA

- messages are not (neccesarily) human readable and don't appear in the
  regular inbox. 

- probably: size of SMA should not grow linearly with number of
  incoming/outgoing mails, for example messages that have been
  processed by a MUA must be deleted

- there should be a policy/expiry of messages for MUAAs which don't
  exist/are not alive anymore

- we only require from IMAP servers that they handle first level folders
  (subfolders are not neccessary)

- there is a header in the messages stored in these folders, indicating
  that the message is an SMA message.

implementation on top of IMAP, pairing happy path
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's suppose we have a first MUAA.  It doesn't find an ``_Autocrypt_SMA``
announcement folder so it will do the following:

- create a random new number "1" which we call MUAA-ID. 

- create an ``_Autocrypt_SMA`` "announcements" folder and 
  append some MUAA description message, most notably
  the MUAA-ID

- create an inbox folder ``_Autocrypt_SMA_1`` where other
  MUAAs will be able to send/drop messages.

If now another MUAA is added:

- create a random new number "27" as MUAA-ID. 

- discover the ``_Autocrypt_SMA`` folder exists and read all 
  of its messages, discover that there is an ``1`` MUAA

- create an inbox folder ``_Autocrypt_SMA_27`` where other
  MUAAs will be able to send/drop messages.

- append a new MUAA description message to ``_Autocrypt_SMA``

- append a pairing request message to the "1" inbox (``_Autocrypt_SMA_1``).

The MUAA "1" will then:

- discover "27" from the new message in the announcement folder ``_Autocrypt_SMA``

- read the pairing request message from its own ``_Autocrypt_SMA_1`` inbox

- process the pairing request and send a pairing accept message to "27" by appending 
  it to the ``_Autocrypt_SMA_27`` folder.  

- delete the pairing request message from its own ``_Autocrypt_SMA_1`` folder.

.. note::

    In this happy path example we are not prescribing the precise pairing procedure,
    merely give an example how bootstrapping into a multi-MUA setting works.
    It is unclear whether a centrally shared keyring as an IMAP folder is viable
    (synchronization between MUAs, "merge conflict" between state, deleting
    message might be a problem, encrypted "broadcast" to all my MUAAs)


.. todo::

    Critically consider how the multiple Autocrypt folders show in user interfaces.
    It might be better to depend on sub folders.

.. todo::

    Crically consider end-to-end encryption for MUAA messages.

.. todo::

    Consider how to force remove devices through IMAP folder deletion or something.

types of inter-MUAA unicast messages
------------------------------------
Difficult to reason about when we don't know what we *really* want to do
(cryptographic protocol wise)

ID announcement
+++++++++++++++

pairing messages
++++++++++++++++
- Some authenticated key exchange so later messages between MUAAs can be encrypted
- Shared private key so messages encrypted to the account's public key
  can be encrypted and outgoing mail can be signed

remote key updates
++++++++++++++++++
- notify other MUAAs that you add to or change an entry to your keyring

Autocrypt -- E-Mail Encryption for Everyone
===========================================

Please see here for automatically regenerated docs from this
repository:

    https://autocrypt.readthedocs.io/

If you want to read and work on the docs locally checkout the `doc
<doc>`_ directory which contains a ``sphinx`` documentation project.
You can `install sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/install.html>`_ and then run
``make html`` in the ``doc`` directory to regenerate docs locally.
